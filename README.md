# Hangman
A python script that plays games of hangman with the user. Entirely text-based.

I made this during 2023. I wanted to see just how well I could transfer hangman over to a purely text-based program, and to also learn how to mess with files in python. After giving it basic functionality, I then continued to develop it further for fun. I added a sort of arcade style of gameplay, putting a little twist on how hangman is usually played.
